# Hey, I'm Viren ðŸ‘‹ 

## About me
I'm a Software Engineer with a versatile background that is primarily composed of full-stack web development, machine learning, and data science experience. Outside of work, I am also the President of my local Toastmasters club and do some modeling/acting gigs on the side as well. Some of my hobbies/interests include playing sports (soccer, basketball, swimming, tennis, pickleball, badminton), cooking, reading, traveling, listening to music, watching TV, and hanging out with friends and family.
